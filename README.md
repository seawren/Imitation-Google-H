This project actually went easier than the first one. I'm not sure why, but the overall layout was simpler to set up. However, I did have a problem with the scrollbar
showing up when I didn't want it to appear; I had to perfectly match up the number of pixels to each other to prevent that. I couldn't work out how to make the cursor 
appear after the placeholder text either, though I'm glad I managed to create the placeholder text. Of course the images are screenshots from google. The text shadow
isn't as similar as I would've liked, and I have no idea how google got their stick search bar to have a shadow and be smaller when you scroll; probably not just 
html/css.
